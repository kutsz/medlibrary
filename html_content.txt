<p class="First ">SERIOUS DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS AND HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 ALLELE</p>
<p>SERIOUS AND SOMETIMES FATAL DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS (TEN) AND STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS), HAVE BEEN REPORTED DURING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE. THESE REACTIONS ARE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR IN 1 TO 6 PER 10,000 NEW USERS IN COUNTRIES WITH MAINLY CAUCASIAN POPULATIONS, BUT THE RISK IN SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 10 TIMES HIGHER. STUDIES IN PATIENTS OF CHINESE ANCESTRY HAVE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING SJS/TEN AND THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502, AN INHERITED ALLELIC VARIANT OF THE HLA-B GENE. HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 IS FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY ACROSS BROAD AREAS OF ASIA. PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK POPULATIONS SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 PRIOR TO INITIATING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE. PATIENTS TESTING POSITIVE FOR THE ALLELE SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH CARBAMAZEPINE UNLESS THE BENEFIT CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE RISK (SEE <strong>WARNINGS</strong> AND <strong>PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</strong>).</p>

<p>APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE. DATA FROM A POPULATION-BASED CASE CONTROL STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THESE REACTIONS IS 5 TO 8 TIMES GREATER THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE OVERALL RISK OF THESE REACTIONS IN THE UNTREATED GENERAL POPULATION IS LOW, APPROXIMATELY SIX PATIENTS PER ONE MILLION POPULATION PER YEAR FOR AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND TWO PATIENTS PER ONE MILLION POPULATION PER YEAR FOR APLASTIC ANEMIA.</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH REPORTS OF TRANSIENT OR PERSISTENT DECREASED PLATELET OR WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNTS ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE, DATA ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ESTIMATE ACCURATELY THEIR INCIDENCE OR OUTCOME. HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CASES OF LEUKOPENIA HAVE NOT PROGRESSED TO THE MORE SERIOUS CONDITIONS OF APLASTIC ANEMIA OR AGRANULOCYTOSIS.</p>
<p>BECAUSE OF THE VERY LOW INCIDENCE OF AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND APLASTIC ANEMIA, THE VAST MAJORITY OF MINOR HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES OBSERVED IN MONITORING OF PATIENTS ON CARBAMAZEPINE ARE UNLIKELY TO SIGNAL THE OCCURRENCE OF EITHER ABNORMALITY. NONETHELESS, COMPLETE PRETREATMENT HEMATOLOGICAL TESTING SHOULD BE OBTAINED AS A BASELINE.

<p class="First ">Epitol, carbamazepine, USP, is an anticonvulsant and specific analgesic for trigeminal neuralgia, available for oral administration as tablets of 200 mg. Its chemical name is 5<em>H</em> -dibenz[<em>b,f</em> ]azepine-5-carboxamide, and its structural formula is:</p>
<div><a id="id-820579381"></a></div>
<img alt="Chemical Image.jpg" src="img/chemicalimage.jpg"><aside id="ab2e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>

<p>Carbamazepine, USP is a white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol and in acetone.</p>
<p>Epitol (carbamazepine tablets USP) 200 mg contain the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, ethylcellulose, glycerin, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and sodium starch glycolate.</p>
<p>Epitol 200 mg tablets meet USP Dissolution Test 3.</p>
<h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<a id="i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_d88ebe6d-6bc0-4664-a461-167011d1a165"></a><a id="section-12"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First ">In controlled clinical trials, carbamazepine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychomotor and grand mal seizures, as well as trigeminal neuralgia.</p>
<h3>Mechanism of Action<a id="i4i_mechanism_action_id_3a805cb7-eb99-4877-b3d1-934f6c33bf71"></a><a id="section-12.1"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Carbamazepine has demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in rats and mice with electrically and chemically induced seizures. It appears to act by reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Carbamazepine greatly reduces or abolishes pain induced by stimulation of the infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It depresses thalamic potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the linguomandibular reflex in cats. Carbamazepine is chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to control the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. The mechanism of action remains unknown.</p>
<p>The principal metabolite of Epitol, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several <em>in vivo</em> animal models of seizures. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance of its activity with respect to the safety and efficacy of Epitol has not been established.</p>
<h3>Pharmacokinetics<a id="i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_c1a5c9d0-0661-49e9-9d57-1d99484b371f"></a><a id="section-12.3"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">In clinical studies, carbamazepine suspension, conventional tablets, and extended-release tablets delivered equivalent amounts of drug to the systemic circulation. However, the suspension was absorbed somewhat faster, and the extended-release tablet slightly slower, than the conventional tablet. The bioavailability of the extended-release tablet was 89% compared to suspension. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, the suspension provides higher peak levels and lower trough levels than those obtained from the conventional tablet for the same dosage regimen. On the other hand, following a t.i.d. dosage regimen, carbamazepine suspension affords steady-state plasma levels comparable to carbamazepine tablets given b.i.d. when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, carbamazepine extended-release tablets afford steady-state plasma levels comparable to conventional carbamazepine tablets given q.i.d., when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Carbamazepine in blood is 76% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma levels of carbamazepine are variable and may range from 0.5 to 25 mcg/mL, with no apparent relationship to the daily intake of the drug. Usual adult therapeutic levels are between 4 and 12 mcg/mL. In polytherapy, the concentration of carbamazepine and concomitant drugs may be increased or decreased during therapy, and drug effects may be altered (see <strong>PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</strong>). Following chronic oral administration of suspension, plasma levels peak at approximately 1.5 hours compared to 4 to 5 hours after administration of conventional carbamazepine tablets, and 3 to 12 hours after administration of carbamazepine extended-release tablets. The CSF/serum ratio is 0.22, similar to the 24% unbound carbamazepine in serum. Because carbamazepine induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Autoinduction is completed after 3 to 5 weeks of a fixed dosing regimen. Initial half-life values range from 25 to 65 hours, decreasing to 12 to 17 hours on repeated doses. Carbamazepine is metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the formation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide from carbamazepine. Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. After oral administration of <sup>14</sup> C-carbamazepine, 72% of the administered radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged carbamazepine.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of carbamazepine disposition are similar in children and in adults. However, there is a poor correlation between plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and Epitol dose in children. Carbamazepine is more rapidly metabolized to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (a metabolite shown to be equipotent to carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant in animal screens) in the younger age groups than in adults. In children below the age of 15, there is an inverse relationship between CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and increasing age (in one report from 0.44 in children below the age of 1 year to 0.18 in children between 10 to 15 years of age).</p>
<p>The effects of race and gender on carbamazepine pharmacokinetics have not been systematically evaluated.</p>

<h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS<a id="i4i_contraindications_id_36f73564-6cd0-405a-acd7-0c066c20c2a3"></a><a id="section-4"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First ">Epitol should not be used in patients with a history of previous bone marrow depression, hypersensitivity to the drug, or known sensitivity to any of the tricyclic compounds, such as amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, protriptyline, nortriptyline, etc. Likewise, on theoretical grounds its use with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors is not recommended. Before administration of Epitol, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued for a minimum of 14 days, or longer if the clinical situation permits.</p>

<h2>WARNINGS<a id="i4i_warnings_id_cdd73f40-4dc6-490a-bca8-ebe200dea408"></a><a id="section-8"></a>
</h2> <h3>Serious Dermatologic Reactions<a id="i4i_section_id_b8247f8d-e515-47eb-8545-b069dab417b0"></a><a id="section-8.1"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</p>
<h3>SJS/TEN and HLA-B<a id="i4i_section_id_faa87a58-fe59-4f17-8057-ad86375b2d66"></a><a id="section-8.2"></a><sup>*</sup> 1502 Allele</h3> <p class="First ">Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity.</p>
<p>Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502, averaging 2% to 4%, but higher in some groups. HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 is present in less than 1% of the population in Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans).</p>
<p><span class="Bold ">Prior to initiating carbamazepine therapy, testing for HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 should be performed in patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 may be present.</span> In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 may offer a rough guide, keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. Carbamazepine should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see <strong>BOXED</strong> <strong>WARNING</strong> and <strong>PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</strong>).</p>
<aside id="ab2e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p>Over 90% of carbamazepine treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on carbamazepine.</p>
<p>The HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from carbamazepine, such as maculopapular eruption (MPE) or to predict Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).</p>
<p>Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable.</p>
<h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions and HLA-A<a id="i4i_section_id_832291fa-6ae6-44c8-b103-7b06b831c508"></a><a id="section-8.3"></a><sup>*</sup> 3101 Allele</h3> <p class="First ">Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese ancestry have found a moderate association between the risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions and the presence of HLA-A<sup>*</sup> 3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using carbamazepine. These hypersensitivity reactions include SJS/TEN, maculopapular eruptions, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (see <strong>DRESS/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity</strong> below). </p>
<p>HLA-A<sup>*</sup> 3101 is expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian (for example, Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in patients of Han Chinese, Korean, European, Latin American, and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry. </p>
<p>The risks and benefits of carbamazepine therapy should be weighed before considering Epitol in patients known to be positive for HLA-A<sup>*</sup> 3101.</p>
<p>Application of HLA genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. Many HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502-positive and HLA-A<sup>*</sup> 3101-positive patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN or other hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B<sup>*</sup> 1502-negative and HLA-A<sup>*</sup> 3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other hypersensitivity reactions, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring, have not been studied.</p>
<h3>Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis<a id="i4i_section_id_dc5101ad-9ef6-41fc-b651-fba19f566c32"></a><a id="section-8.4"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported in association with the use of Epitol (see <strong>BOXED WARNING</strong>). Patients with a history of adverse hematologic reaction to any drug may be particularly at risk of bone marrow depression.</p>
<h3>Drug Reaction With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity<a id="i4i_section_id_63f962c5-1734-4b07-8319-f7acc87ccdb7"></a><a id="section-8.5"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has occurred with Epitol. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Epitol should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p>
<h4>Hypersensitivity<a id="i4i_section_id_2cb092ad-3003-4eb9-9087-07c84364b9ef"></a><a id="section-8.5.1"></a>
</h4> <p class="First ">Hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine have been reported in patients who previously experienced this reaction to anticonvulsants including phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital. If such history is present, benefits and risks should be carefully considered and, if carbamazepine is initiated, the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity should be carefully monitored. </p>
<p>Patients should be informed that about a third of patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine also experience hypersensitivity reactions with oxcarbazepine.</p>
<h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation<a id="i4i_section_id_4921cca2-3184-481f-b3f7-04db5674b1a6"></a><a id="section-8.6"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Epitol, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. <strong>Table 1</strong> shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p>
<p>Anyone considering prescribing Epitol or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>

</h3> <p class="First ">Epitol has shown mild anticholinergic activity that may be associated with increased intraocular pressure; therefore, patients with increased intraocular pressure should be closely observed during therapy.</p>
<p>Because of the relationship of the drug to other tricyclic compounds, the possibility of activation of a latent psychosis and, in elderly patients, of confusion or agitation should be borne in mind.</p>
<p>The use of carbamazepine should be avoided in patients with a history of hepatic porphyria (e.g., acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda). Acute attacks have been reported in such patients receiving carbamazepine therapy. Carbamazepine administration has also been demonstrated to increase porphyrin precursors in rodents, a presumed mechanism for the induction of acute attacks of porphyria.</p>

</aside><p>As with all antiepileptic drugs, Epitol should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency.</p>
<p>Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with Epitol. In many cases, the hyponatremia appears to be caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with Epitol treatment appears to be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Consider discontinuing Epitol in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Consider discontinuing Epitol in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.</p>
<h3>Usage in Pregnancy<a id="i4i_pregnancy_id_48aff862-dee7-4b9a-b36d-6eb852834818"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina bifida. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, and anomalies involving various body systems). Developmental delays based on neurobehavioral assessments have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.</p>
<p>In humans, transplacental passage of carbamazepine is rapid (30 to 60 minutes), and the drug is accumulated in the fetal tissues, with higher levels found in liver and kidney than in brain and lung.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine has been shown to have adverse effects in reproduction studies in rats when given orally in dosages 10 to 25 times the maximum human daily dosage (MHDD) of 1200 mg on a mg/kg basis or 1.5 to 4 times the MHDD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. In rat teratology studies, 2 of 135 offspring showed kinked ribs at 250 mg/kg and 4 of 119 offspring at 650 mg/kg showed other anomalies (cleft palate, 1; talipes, 1; anophthalmos, 2). In reproduction studies in rats, nursing offspring demonstrated a lack of weight gain and an unkempt appearance at a maternal dosage level of 200 mg/kg.</p>
<aside id="ab2e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p>Antiepileptic drugs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the seizure disorder are such that removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy, although it cannot be said with any confidence that even minor seizures do not pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus.</p>
<p>Tests to detect defects using currently accepted procedures should be considered a part of routine prenatal care in childbearing women receiving carbamazepine.</p>
<p>There have been a few cases of neonatal seizures and/or respiratory depression associated with maternal carbamazepine and other concomitant anticonvulsant drug use. A few cases of neonatal vomiting, diarrhea, and/or decreased feeding have also been reported in association with maternal Epitol use. These symptoms may represent a neonatal withdrawal syndrome.</p>
<p>To provide information regarding the effects of <em>in utero</em> exposure to Epitol, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking Epitol enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p>
<h2>PRECAUTIONS<a id="i4i_precautions_id_d76ce770-14fc-4fe0-9470-2e7d1f10dfc6"></a><a id="section-9"></a>

</h3> <p class="First ">Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made.</p>
<p>Epitol should be used with caution in patients with a mixed seizure disorder that includes atypical absence seizures, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see <strong>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</strong>).</p>
<p>Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree AV heart block; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs, including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with carbamazepine.</p>
<p>AV heart block, including second- and third-degree block, have been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances.</p>
<p>Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure have been reported (see <strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong> and <strong>PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</strong>). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition rare instances of vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS syndrome) and serious dermatologic reactions. As an example there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.</p>
<h3>Information for Patients<a id="i4i_info_patients_id_008b1b00-ae04-4c8a-96be-bb9edc9c6f06"></a><a id="section-9.17"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide before taking Epitol.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of a potential hematologic problem, as well as dermatologic, hypersensitivity or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. The patient should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with Epitol. In the event a skin reaction should occur while taking Epitol, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see<strong> WARNINGS</strong>).</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including Epitol, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive sedative effect.</p>
<p>Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see <strong>WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy</strong>).</p>

<p>Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops.</p>
<aside id="ab1e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p>Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since liver damage may occur (see <strong>PRECAUTIONS, General</strong> and <strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>). Carbamazepine should be discontinued, based on clinical judgment, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, or in the case of active liver disease.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels (see<strong> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</strong>) has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful in cases of dramatic increase in seizure frequency and for verification of compliance. In addition, measurement of drug serum levels may aid in determining the cause of toxicity when more than one medication is being used.</p>
<p>Thyroid function tests have been reported to show decreased values with carbamazepine administered alone.</p>
<p>Interference with some pregnancy tests has been reported.</p>

<h3>Agents That May Affect Carbamazepine Plasma Levels<a id="i4i_section_id_668325f6-426f-4ee5-9f3a-e44c00c8170a"></a><a id="section-9.5"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">When carbamazepine is given with drugs that can increase or decrease carbamazepine levels, close monitoring of carbamazepine levels is indicated and dosage adjustment may be required.</p>
<p> <em>Agents That Increase Carbamazepine Levels</em> </p>
<p>CYP3A4 inhibitors inhibit carbamazepine metabolism and can thus increase plasma carbamazepine levels. Drugs that have been shown, or would be expected, to increase plasma carbamazepine levels include aprepitant, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, danazol, diltiazem, macrolides, erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, trazodone, olanzapine, loratadine, terfenadine, omeprazole, oxybutynin, dantrolene, isoniazid, niacinamide, nicotinamide, ibuprofen, propoxyphene, azoles (e.g., ketaconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), acetazolamide, verapamil, ticlopidine, grapefruit juice, and protease inhibitors.</p>
<aside id="ab2e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p>Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. Coadministration of inhibitors of human microsomal epoxide hydrolase may result in increased carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide plasma concentrations. Accordingly, the dosage of carbamazepine should be adjusted and/or the plasma levels monitored when used concomitantly with loxapine, quetiapine, or valproic acid.</p>
<p> <em>Agents That Decrease Carbamazepine Levels</em> </p>
<p>CYP3A4 inducers can increase the rate of carbamazepine metabolism. Drugs that have been shown, or that would be expected, to decrease plasma carbamazepine levels include cisplatin, doxorubicin HCl, felbamate, fosphenytoin, rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, methsuximide, theophylline, aminophylline.</p>
<h3>Effect of Carbamazepine on Plasma Levels of Concomitant Agents<a id="i4i_section_id_4b9de6a1-cfe4-421c-be6d-0a95d0253c20"></a><a id="section-9.6"></a>
</h3> <p class="First "> <em>Decreased Levels of Concomitant Medications</em> </p>
<p>Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic 3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. When used concomitantly with carbamazepine, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary:</p>
<dl>
<dt style="float:left">â¢</dt> <dd>When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. </dd> <dt style="float:left">â¢</dt> <dd>When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended. </dd> <dt style="float:left">â¢</dt> <dd>The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered. </dd> <dt style="float:left">â¢</dt> <dd>The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, the lapatinib dose should be reduced.</dd> <dt style="float:left">â¢</dt> <dd>Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see <strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>).</dd> <dt style="float:left">â¢</dt> <dd>Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine is introduced or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid.</dd> </dl>
<p>In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of the following drugs, for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphone, bupropion, citalopram, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporine, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., felodipine), doxycycline, ethosuximide, everolimus, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, methadone, methsuximide, mianserin, midazolam, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives, oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phensuximide, phenytoin, praziquantel, protease inhibitors, risperidone, sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, trazodone, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin, ziprasidone, zonisamide.</p>

Whether or not carbamazepine has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher.</dd> </dl>
<h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<a id="i4i_carcinogenesis_mutagenesis_fertility_id_fb97f7fd-0f5c-4e23-b11a-d14fd84404d4"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Carbamazepine, when administered to Sprague-Dawley rats for two years in the diet at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day, resulted in a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors in females and of benign interstitial cell adenomas in the testes of males.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine must, therefore, be considered to be carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. Bacterial and mammalian mutagenicity studies using carbamazepine produced negative results. The significance of these findings relative to the use of carbamazepine in humans is, at present, unknown.</p>

<h3>Nursing Mothers<a id="i4i_nursing_mothers_id_dab9eab4-0279-4d48-8fb0-b201e66ac916"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite are transferred to breast milk. The ratio of the concentration in breast milk to that in maternal plasma is about 0.4 for carbamazepine and about 0.5 for the epoxide. The estimated doses given to the newborn during breastfeeding are in the range of 2 to 5 mg daily for carbamazepine and 1 to 2 mg daily for the epoxide.</p>
<aside id="ab1e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from carbamazepine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<h3>Pediatric Use<a id="i4i_pediatric_use_id_d963855c-6910-4def-ba6d-4074cf4dd14f"></a><a id="section-9.4"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Substantial evidence of carbamazepineâs effectiveness for use in the management of children with epilepsy (see<strong> INDICATIONS AND USAGE</strong> for specific seizure types) is derived from clinical investigations performed in adults and from studies in several <em>in vitro</em> systems which support the conclusion that (1) the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation are essentially identical in adults and children, and (2) the mechanism of action of carbamazepine in treating seizures is essentially identical in adults and children.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this information supports a conclusion that the generally accepted therapeutic range of total carbamazepine in plasma (i.e., 4 to 12 mcg/mL) is the same in children and adults.</p>
<p>The evidence assembled was primarily obtained from short-term use of carbamazepine. The safety of carbamazepine in children has been systematically studied up to 6 months. No longer-term data from clinical trials is available.</p>
<h3>Geriatric Use<a id="i4i_geriatric_use_id_0d9f9b16-a185-4130-a136-6564e83a67ec"></a>

</h2>
<p class="First ">If adverse reactions are of such severity that the drug must be discontinued, the physician must be aware that abrupt discontinuation of any anticonvulsant drug in a responsive epileptic patient may lead to seizures or even status epilepticus with its life-threatening hazards.</p>
<p>The most severe adverse reactions have been observed in the hemopoietic system and skin (see <strong>BOXED WARNING</strong>), the liver, and the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>The most frequently observed adverse reactions, particularly during the initial phases of therapy, are dizziness, drowsiness, unsteadiness, nausea, and vomiting. To minimize the possibility of such reactions, therapy should be initiated at the lowest dosage recommended.</p>
<p>The following additional adverse reactions have been reported:</p>

<p>Testicular atrophy occurred in rats receiving carbamazepine orally from 4 to 52 weeks at dosage levels of 50 to 400 mg/kg/day. Additionally, rats receiving carbamazepine in the diet for 2 years at dosage levels of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day had a dose-related incidence of testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis. In dogs, it produced a brownish discoloration, presumably a metabolite, in the urinary bladder at dosage levels of 50 mg/kg and higher. Relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Nervous System:</em> </span> Dizziness, drowsiness, disturbances of coordination, confusion, headache, fatigue, blurred vision, visual hallucinations, transient diplopia, oculomotor disturbances, nystagmus, speech disturbances, abnormal involuntary movements, peripheral neuritis and paresthesias, depression with agitation, talkativeness, tinnitus, hyperacusis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome.</p>
<p>There have been reports of associated paralysis and other symptoms of cerebral arterial insufficiency, but the exact relationship of these reactions to the drug has not been established.</p>
<p>Isolated cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported both with and without concomitant use of psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Digestive System:</em> </span> Nausea, vomiting, gastric distress and abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, and dryness of the mouth and pharynx, including glossitis and stomatitis.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Eyes:</em> </span> Scattered punctate cortical lens opacities, increased intraocular pressure (see <strong>WARNINGS</strong> , <strong>General</strong>) as well as conjunctivitis, have been reported.

</h3> <p class="First ">The prognosis in cases of severe poisoning is critically dependent upon prompt elimination of the drug, which may be achieved by inducing vomiting, irrigating the stomach, and by taking appropriate steps to diminish absorption. If these measures cannot be implemented without risk on the spot, the patient should be transferred at once to a hospital, while ensuring that vital functions are safeguarded. There is no specific antidote.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Elimination of the Drug:</em> </span> Induction of vomiting.</p>
<p>Gastric lavage. Even when more than 4 hours have elapsed following ingestion of the drug, the stomach should be repeatedly irrigated, especially if the patient has also consumed alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="Bold "><em>Hypotension, Shock:</em> </span> Keep the patientâs legs raised and administer a plasma expander. If blood pressure fails to rise despite measures taken to increase plasma volume, use of vasoactive substances should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Convulsions:</em> </span> Diazepam or barbiturates.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Warning:</em> </span> Diazepam or barbiturates may aggravate respiratory depression (especially in children), hypotension, and coma. However, barbiturates should <span class="Underline ">not</span> be used if drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase have also been taken by the patient either in overdosage or in recent therapy (within 1 week).</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Surveillance:</em> </span> Respiration, cardiac function (ECG monitoring), blood pressure, body temperature, pupillary reflexes, and kidney and bladder function should be monitored for several days.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Treatment of Blood Count Abnormalities:</em> </span> If evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops, the following recommendations are suggested: (1) stop the drug, (2) perform daily CBC, platelet, and reticulocyte counts, (3) do a bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy immediately and repeat with sufficient frequency to monitor recovery.</p>
<p>Special periodic studies might be helpful as follows: (1) white cell and platelet antibodies, (2) <sup>59</sup> Fe-ferrokinetic studies, (3) peripheral blood cell typing, (4) cytogenetic studies on marrow and peripheral blood, (5) bone marrow culture studies for colony-forming units, (6) hemoglobin electrophoresis for A<sub>2</sub> and F hemoglobin, and (7) serum folic acid and B<sub>12</sub> levels.</p>

<p>Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see <strong>PRECAUTIONS</strong> , <strong>Laboratory Tests</strong>). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.</p>
<p>Conversion of patients from oral Epitol<sup>Â®</sup> tablets to carbamazepine suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension).</p>

<p> <strong>Epitol can cause serious side effects, including: </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>1. Epitol may cause rare but serious skin rashes that may lead to death. These serious skin reactions are more likely to happen when you begin taking Epitol within the first four months of treatment but may occur at later times. These reactions can happen in anyone, but are more likely in people of Asian descent. If you are of Asian descent, you may need a genetic blood test before you take Epitol to see if you are at a higher risk for serious skin reactions with this medicine. Symptoms may include: </strong> </p>
