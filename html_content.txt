</h2>
<p class="First ">Use lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals for the individual patient. These doses can be given without regard to timing of meals.</p>
<h3>2.1 Osteoarthritis<a id="L428cfafe-febb-4ff6-8f20-6fbae581aa9a"></a><a id="section-2.1"></a>
</h3> <aside id="ab2e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p class="First ">For relief of the signs and symptoms of OA the recommended oral dose is 200 mg per day administered as a single dose or as 100 mg twice daily.</p>

</h3> <p class="First ">For the relief of the signs and symptoms of JRA the recommended oral dose for pediatric patients (age 2 years and older) is based on weight. For patients <span class="Underline ">&gt;</span>10 kg to <span class="Underline ">&lt;</span>25 kg the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily. For patients &gt;25 kg the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily.</p>
<p>For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of a celecoxib capsule can be added to applesauce. The entire capsule contents are carefully emptied onto a level teaspoon of cool or room temperature applesauce and ingested immediately with water. The sprinkled capsule contents on applesauce are stable for up to 6 hours under refrigerated conditions (2 to 8° C/ 35 to 45° F).</p>
<h3>2.4 Ankylosing Spondylitis<a id="L1cec3764-e962-4bde-a6bb-a7f7106b056b"></a><a id="section-2.4"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">For the management of the signs and symptoms of AS, the recommended dose of celecoxib is 200 mg daily in single (once per day) or divided (twice per day) doses. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg daily may be worthwhile. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks on 400 mg daily, a response is not likely and consideration should be given to alternate treatment options.</p>

</h3> <p class="First ">The recommended dose of celecoxib is 400 mg initially, followed by an additional 200 mg dose if needed on the first day. On subsequent days, the recommended dose is 200 mg twice daily as needed.</p>
<h3>2.6 Special Populations<a id="Lee1b2da3-acde-40c3-abc9-2e3ae8713850"></a><a id="section-2.6"></a>
</h3> <p class="First "><strong>Hepatic insufficiency:</strong> The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and<br>Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p>
<p><strong>Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates:</strong> Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution.<br>Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e. CYP2C9*3/*3). Consider using alternative management in JRA patients who are poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific populations (8.8), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].</p>
<h2>3. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS<a id="L855fdf64-cc7a-4708-acc1-998a44efcd81"></a><a id="section-3"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First ">Capsules: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg</p>
<h2>4. CONTRAINDICATIONS<a id="Lbe3f7f4c-729d-464b-9386-32341859e10f"></a><a id="section-4"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First ">Celecoxib is contraindicated:</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> In patients with known hypersensitivity to celecoxib, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.<br><strong>•</strong> In patients who have demonstrated allergic-type reactions to sulfonamides.<br><strong>•</strong> In patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe anaphylactoid       reactions to NSAIDs, some of them fatal,have been reported in such patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.13)]<br><strong>•</strong> For the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft(CABG) surgery <em>[see Warnings andPrecautions  (5.1)].</em> </p>
<h2>5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS<a id="Lda9f09a3-3575-4799-847d-acb057d7636a"></a><a id="section-5"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First "></p>
<h3>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<a id="L56cce58c-2fd9-4a94-b30d-e886fc083df0"></a><a id="section-5.1"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Chronic use of celecoxib may cause an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. In the APC (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) trial, the hazard ratio for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular<br>death, MI, or stroke was 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 to 8.5) for celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 to 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily compared to placebo. Cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3% (20/671 subjects) and 2.5% (17/685 subjects), respectively, compared to 0.9% (6/679 subjects) with placebo treatment. The increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo-treated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].</p>
<p>All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and non-selective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with celecoxib, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or<br>symptoms of serious CV toxicity and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and celecoxib does increase the risk of serious GI events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</p>
<p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a different COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke <em>[see Contraindications (4)].</em> </p>

<h3>5.2 Hypertension<a id="L6617e15a-538c-495f-a05b-476a08b84c42"></a><a id="section-5.2"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">As with all NSAIDs, celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including celecoxib, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with celecoxib and throughout the course of therapy. The rates of hypertension from the CLASS trial in the celecoxib, ibuprofen and diclofenac-treated patients were 2.4%, 4.2% and 2.5%, respectively <em>[see Clinical Studies (14.6)].</em> </p>
<h3>5.3 Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<a id="L29267c0f-6342-4865-9d73-bbcae2b9375b"></a><a id="section-5.3"></a>
</h3> <aside id="ab1e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p class="First ">Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs, including celecoxib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In the CLASS study [see Clinical Studies (14.6)], the Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months of peripheral edema in patients on celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 4.5%, 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Celecoxib should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.</p>
<h3>5.4 Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects<a id="L715e2566-8cb6-4d46-a126-ae1026a0a778"></a><a id="section-5.4"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation<br>NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can cause serious gastrointestinal events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. With longer duration of use of NSAIDs, there is a trend for increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Physicians and patients should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during<br>celecoxib therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>
<h3>5.5 Hepatic Effects<a id="La315fa5d-0c6b-468e-a51d-83c97689bbc3"></a><a id="section-5.5"></a>
</h3> <aside id="ab2e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p class="First ">Borderline elevations of one or more liver-associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including celecoxib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.</p>
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with celecoxib. If clinical signs and symptoms<br>consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), celecoxib should be discontinued.</p>
<h3>5.6 Renal Effects<a id="L7c64e501-82ed-4a01-885e-a2a53ccdeb3c"></a><a id="section-5.6"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of<br>an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver<br>dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs.</p>
<p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with celecoxib is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If celecoxib therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient’s renal function is advisable.</p>
<h3>5.7 Anaphylactoid Reactions<a id="L0ad55c10-6900-47bd-8030-c4fb529e722d"></a><a id="section-5.7"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">As with NSAIDs in general, anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients without known prior exposure to celecoxib. In postmarketing experience, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported in patients receiving celecoxib. Celecoxib should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4),<br>Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</p>
<h3>5.8 Skin Reactions<a id="L750ef3af-c54f-494a-8d10-d82d02ce6674"></a><a id="section-5.8"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events can occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p>
<h3>5.9 Pregnancy<a id="La276a120-af69-4062-83cc-265ea5f464c2"></a><a id="section-5.9"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">In late pregnancy, starting at 30 weeks gestation, celecoxib should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus <em>[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</em> </p>
<h3>5.10 Corticosteroid Treatment<a id="Le65fea2a-423d-49f5-8c8c-a627ffc489c3"></a><a id="section-5.10"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Celecoxib cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p>
<h3>5.11 Hematological Effects<a id="L5008772f-a0b3-4d31-ab0b-2de84cff57fb"></a><a id="section-5.11"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving celecoxib. In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. Celecoxib does not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and does not inhibit platelet aggregation at indicated dosages <em>[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</em> </p>
<h3>5.12 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)<a id="Ld826b832-7af5-4aa6-85d4-de401c8f3dba"></a><a id="section-5.12"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Celecoxib should be used only with caution in pediatric patients with systemic onset JRA due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p>
<h3>5.13 Preexisting Asthma<a id="Lc5feed5e-ed56-4140-966d-5b04bc0b0ded"></a><a id="section-5.13"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</p>

</h3> <p class="First ">Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, celecoxib should be discontinued.</p>
<p>In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.</p>

</h2>
<p class="First ">Of the celecoxib-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of celecoxib of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received celecoxib at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more.</p>
<p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reactioninformation from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p>

<h2>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS<a id="L5c635243-c589-4407-8dec-31b94aed6029"></a><a id="section-7"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First "><strong>General:</strong> Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver. Co-administration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 should be done with caution. Significant interactions may occur when celecoxib is administered together with drugs that inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.</p>
<p><em>In vitro</em> studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.</p>
<h3>7.1 Warfarin<a id="L1b6648c6-0d6f-498c-a19b-b832a1faa1ab"></a><a id="section-7.1"></a>
</h3> <aside id="ab2e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p class="First ">Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days, after initiating or changing celecoxib therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications. The effect of celecoxib on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily 2 to 5 mg doses of warfarin. In these subjects, celecoxib did not alter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, in postmarketing experience, serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving celecoxib concurrently with warfarin.</p>
<h3>7.2 Lithium<a id="L9999b5bc-59b7-4757-bb68-67d0c9da0db3"></a><a id="section-7.2"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg twice daily with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or with drawn.</p>
<h3>7.3 Aspirin<a id="La39566ae-41e5-4b6f-9d86-62c070d38763"></a><a id="section-7.3"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Celecoxib can be used with low-dose aspirin. However, concomitant administration of aspirin with celecoxib increases the rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of celecoxib alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. </p>
<p> <span class="Bold ">Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis [see <em>Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</em> ].</span> </p>
<h3>7.4 ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists<a id="L3e915643-7245-4d95-b0f6-60dab90c7213"></a><a id="section-7.4"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking celecoxib concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists [see <em>Clinical Pharmacology (12.2]</em>.</p>
<h3>7.5 Fluconazole<a id="L4279241f-4a4e-4cbf-a218-957b3f7dd3b0"></a><a id="section-7.5"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Concomitant administration of fluconazole at 200 mg once daily resulted in a two-fold increase in celecoxib plasma concentration. This increase is due to the inhibition of celecoxib metabolism via P450 2C9 by fluconazole [see <em>Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</em>. Celecoxib should be introduced at the lowest recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole.</p>
<h3>7.6 Furosemide<a id="L64c8e612-0b8f-4ff7-ada3-05660d86c01c"></a><a id="section-7.6"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.</p>
<h3>7.7 Methotrexate<a id="L940627fc-74ad-42ae-af94-d7646233b84b"></a><a id="section-7.7"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">In an interaction study of rheumatoid arthritis patients taking methotrexate, celecoxib did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate [see <em>Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</em>.</p>
<h3>7.8 Concomitant NSAID Use<a id="L3360c9ea-59ea-4f67-9a0e-d96e176d53c5"></a><a id="section-7.8"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">The concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.</p>
<h2>8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS<a id="La33d4a5f-ee27-4cb0-b44c-b068812d4ebf"></a><a id="section-8"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First ">Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting at 30 weeks gestation (5.9, 8.1, 17.8)</p>
<h3>8.1 Pregnancy<a id="L21647a6e-fbe4-4281-a92d-32114426caf1"></a><a id="section-8.1"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Pregnancy Category C. Pregnancy category D from 30 weeks of gestation onward.</p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Teratogenic effects:</strong> </span>Celecoxib at oral doses <span class="Underline ">&gt;</span>150 mg/kg/day (approximately 2-fold human exposure at 200 mg twice daily as measured by AUC<sub>0 to 24</sub> ), caused an increased incidence of ventricular septal defects, a rare event, and fetal alterations, such as ribs fused, sternebrae fused and sternebrae misshapen when rabbits were treated throughout organogenesis. A dose-dependent increase in diaphragmatic hernias was observed when rats were given celecoxib at oral doses <span class="Underline ">&gt;</span>30 mg/kg/day (approximately 6-fold human exposure based on the AUC<sub>0 to 24</sub> at 200 mg twice daily) throughout organogenesis. There are no studies in pregnant women. Celecoxib should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Nonteratogenic effects:</strong> </span>Celecoxib produced pre-implantation and post-implantation losses and reduced embryo/fetal survival in rats at oral dosages <span class="Underline ">&gt;</span>50 mg/kg/day (approximately 6-fold human exposure based on the AUC<sub>0 to 24</sub> at 200 mg twice daily). These changes are expected with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are not the result of permanent alteration of female reproductive function, nor are they expected at clinical exposures. No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the closure of the ductus arteriosus in humans. Therefore, use of celecoxib during the third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided.</p>

<h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers<a id="L26b7fb79-df9c-44fd-a467-a156edefcf1f"></a><a id="section-8.3"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Limited data from 3 published reports that included a total of 12 breastfeeding women showed low levels of celecoxib in breast milk. The calculated average daily infant dose was 10 to 40 mcg/kg/day, less than 1% of the weight-based therapeutic dose for a two-year old-child. A report of two breastfed infants 17 and 22 months of age did not show any adverse events. Caution should be exercised when celecoxib is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<h3>8.4 Pediatric Use<a id="L3483e3a2-eda1-4f0b-869e-66387f25efe4"></a><a id="section-8.4"></a>
</h3> <aside id="ab1e" style="display:none"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3862246084592963"></ins>
</aside><p class="First ">Celecoxib is approved for relief of the signs and symptoms of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis in patients 2 years and older. Safety and efficacy have not been studied beyond six months in children. The long-term cardiovascular toxicity in children exposed to celecoxib has not been evaluated and it is unknown if long-term risks may be similar to that seen in adults exposed to celecoxib or other COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.12), and <em>Clinical Studies (14.3)].</em> </p>
<p>The use of celecoxib in patients 2 years to 17 years of age with pauciarticular, polyarticular course JRA or in patients with systemic onset JRA was studied in a 12-week, double-blind, active controlled, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy study, with a 12-week open-label extension. Celecoxib has not been studied in patients under the age of 2 years, in patients with body weight less than 10 kg (22 lbs), and in patients with active systemic features. Patients with systemic onset JRA (without active systemic features) appear to be at risk for the development of abnormal coagulation laboratory tests. In some patients with systemic onset JRA, both celecoxib and naproxen were associated with mild prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) but not prothrombin time (PT). NSAIDs including celecoxib should be used only with caution in patients with systemic onset JRA, due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patients with systemic onset JRA should be monitored for the development of abnormal coagulation tests [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Adverse Reactions (6.3), Animal Toxicology (13.2), <em>Clinical Studies (14.3)].</em> </p>
<p>Alternative therapies for treatment of JRA should be considered in pediatric patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (8.8)].</p>
<h3>8.5 Geriatric Use<a id="L456f9f6c-2dce-41a5-9a99-4f083edefb0b"></a><a id="section-8.5"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients <em>[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].</em> </p>

</aside><p class="First ">The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and <em>Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</em> </p>

</h3> <p class="First ">Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e., CYP2C9*3/*3). Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and <em>Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].</em> </p>
<h2>10 OVERDOSAGE<a id="Lfb2ce55c-dda3-4b63-b10d-436ce7904486"></a><a id="section-10"></a>
</h2>
<p class="First ">No overdoses of celecoxib were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2400 mg/day for up to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.</p>
<p>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. No information is available regarding the removal of celecoxib by hemodialysis, but based on its high degree of plasma protein binding (&gt;97%) dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p>

<h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action<a id="L66e95b5b-f599-4c71-9797-50315048ea3d"></a><a id="section-12.1"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of celecoxib is believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, primarily via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and at therapeutic concentrations in humans, celecoxib does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) isoenzyme. In animal colon tumor models, celecoxib reduced the incidence and multiplicity of tumors.</p>
<h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics<a id="L3e6bc440-0564-4dc7-a04e-b117289e71a4"></a><a id="section-12.2"></a>
</h3> <p class="First "><strong>Platelets:</strong> In clinical trials using normal volunteers, celecoxib at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration (higher than recommended therapeutic doses) had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time. Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if there are any effects of celecoxib on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of celecoxib.</p>
<p><strong>Fluid Retention:</strong> Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron. In the collecting ducts, PGE2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone.</p>
<h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics<a id="La2dafe0b-74b5-4760-bffb-f50658f994f4"></a><a id="section-12.3"></a>
</h3> <p class="First "><strong>Absorption:</strong> Peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hrs after an oral dose. Under fasting conditions, both peak plasma levels (C<sub>max </sub> ) and area under the curve (AUC) are roughly dose-proportional up to 200 mg BID; at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC [see Food Effects]. Absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted. With multiple dosing, steady-state conditions are reached on or before Day 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib in a group of healthy subjects are shown in Table 3. </p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Subjects under fasting conditions (n=36, 19 to 52 yrs.)</p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Food Effects:</strong> </span>When celecoxib capsules were taken with a high fat meal, peak plasma levels were delayed for about 1 to 2 hours with an increase in total absorption (AUC) of 10% to 20%. Under fasting conditions, at doses above 200 mg, there is less than a proportional increase in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC, which is thought to be due to the low solubility of the drug in aqueous media.<br>Coadministration of celecoxib with an aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids resulted in a reduction in plasma celecoxib concentrations with a decrease of 37% in C<sub>max</sub> and 10% in AUC. Celecoxib, at doses up to 200 mg twice daily, can be administered without regard to timing of meals. Higher doses (400 mg twice daily) should be administered with food to improve absorption. In healthy adult volunteers, the overall systemic exposure (AUC) of celecoxib was equivalent when celecoxib was administered as intact capsule or capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce. There were no significant alterations in C<sub>max</sub> , T<sub>max</sub> or t<sub>1/2</sub> after administration of capsule contents on applesauce [see Dosage and Administration (2)].</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Distribution:</em> </span>In healthy subjects, celecoxib is highly protein bound (~97%) within the clinical dose range. In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib binds primarily to albumin and, to a lesser extent, α<sub>1</sub> -acid glycoprotein. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) is 1 approximately 400 L, suggesting extensive distribution into the tissues. Celecoxib is not preferentially bound to red blood cells.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Metabolism:</em> </span>Celecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via CYP2C9. Three metabolites, a primary alcohol, the corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate, have been identified in human plasma. These metabolites are inactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Excretion:</em> </span> Celecoxib is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism with little (&lt;3%) unchanged drug recovered in the urine and feces. Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug, approximately 57% of the dose was excreted in the feces and 27% was excreted into the urine. The primary metabolite in both urine and feces was the carboxylic acid metabolite (73% of dose) with low amounts of the glucuronide also appearing in the urine. It appears that the low solubility of the drug prolongs the absorption process making terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> ) determinations more variable. The effective half-life is approximately 11 hours under fasted conditions. The apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) is about 500 mL/min.</p>
<p><span class="Bold "><em>Geriatric:</em> </span> At steady state, elderly subjects (over 65 years old) had a 40% higher C<sub>max</sub> and a 50% higher AUC compared to the young subjects. In elderly females, celecoxib C<sub>max</sub> and AUC are higher than those for elderly males, but these increases are predominantly due to lower body weight in elderly females. Dose adjustment in the elderly is not generally necessary. However, for patients of less than 50 kg in body weight, initiate therapy at the lowest recommended dose <em>[see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</em>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Pediatric:</strong> </span> The steady state pharmacokinetics of celecoxib administered as an investigational oral suspension was evaluated in 152 JRA patients 2 years to 17 years of age weighing <span class="Underline ">&gt;</span>10 kg with pauciarticular or polyarticular course JRA and in patients with systemic onset JRA. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the oral clearance (unadjusted for body weight) of celecoxib increases less than proportionally to increasing weight, with 10 kg and 25 kg patients predicted to have 40% and 24% lower clearance, respectively, compared with a 70 kg adult RA patient.</p>
<p>Twice-daily administration of 50 mg capsules to JRA patients weighing <span class="Underline ">&gt;</span>12 to <span class="Underline ">&lt;</span>25 kg and 100 mg capsules to JRA patients weighing &gt;25 kg should achieve plasma concentrations similar to those observed in a clinical trial that demonstrated the non-inferiority of celecoxib to naproxen 7.5 mg/kg twice daily <em>[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</em>. Celecoxib has not been studied in JRA patients under the age of 2 years, in patients with body weight less than 10 kg (22 lbs), or beyond 24 weeks.</p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Race:</strong> </span> Meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic studies has suggested an approximately 40% higher AUC of celecoxib in Blacks compared to Caucasians. The cause and clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Hepatic Insufficiency:</strong> </span> A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment has shown that steady-state celecoxib AUC is increased about 40% and 180%, respectively, above that seen in healthy control subjects. Therefore, the daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules should be reduced by approximately 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [<em>see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</em> </p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Renal Insufficiency:</strong> </span> In a cross-study comparison, celecoxib AUC was approximately 40% lower in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (GFR 35 to 60 mL/min) than that seen in subjects with normal renal function. No significant relationship was found between GFR and celecoxib clearance. Patients with severe renal insufficiency have not been studied. Similar to other NSAIDs, celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency <em>[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</em> </p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Drug interactions: </strong> </span>In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9, 2C19 or 3A4. <em>In vivo studies have shown the following:</em> </p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Lithium:</strong> </span>In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg twice daily with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone<em> [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</em> </p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Fluconazole</strong>: </span>Concomitant administration of fluconazole at 200 mg once daily resulted in a two-fold increase in celecoxib plasma concentration. This increase is due to the inhibition of celecoxib metabolism via P450 2C9 by fluconazole<em> [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. </em> </p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Other Drugs:</strong> </span>The effects of celecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of glyburide, ketoconazole, methotrexate [see Drug Interactions (7.7)], phenytoin, and tolbutamide have been studied in vivo and clinically important interactions have not been found.</p>

</h3> <p class="First ">CYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity, such as those homozygous for the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms. Limited data from 4 published reports that included a total of 8 subjects with the homozygous CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype showed celecoxib systemic levels that were 3- to 7fold higher in these subjects compared to subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 or *I/*3 genotypes. The pharmacokinetics of celecoxib have not been evaluated in subjects with other CYP2C9 polymorphisms, such as *2, *5, *6, *9 and *11. It is estimated that the frequency of the homozygous *3/ *3 genotype is 0.3% to 1% in various ethnic groups. <em>[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].</em> </p>

These reproductive findings while apparently treatment-related did not increase in incidence or severity with dose and may indicate an exacerbation of a spontaneous condition. Similar reproductive findings were not observed in studies of juvenile or adult dogs or in adult rats treated with celecoxib. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.</p>

</h3> <p class="First ">Celecoxib has demonstrated significant reduction in joint pain compared to placebo. Celecoxib was evaluated for treatment of the signs and the symptoms of OA of the knee and hip in placebo- and active-controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks duration. In patients with OA, treatment with celecoxib 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily resulted in improvement in WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) osteoarthritis index, a composite of pain, stiffness, and functional measures in OA. In three 12-week studies of pain accompanying OA flare, celecoxib doses of 100 mg twice daily and 200 mg twice daily provided significant reduction of pain within 24 to 48 hours of initiation of dosing. At doses of 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg twice daily the effectiveness of celecoxib was shown to be similar to that of naproxen 500 mg twice daily. Doses of 200 mg twice daily provided no additional benefit above that seen with 100 mg twice daily. A total daily dose of 200 mg has been shown to be equally effective whether administered as 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily.</p>

Celecoxib was evaluated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of RA in placebo- and active-controlled clinical trials of up to 24 weeks in duration. Celecoxib was shown to be superior to placebo in these studies, using the ACR20 Responder Index, a composite of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures in RA. Celecoxib doses of 100 mg twice daily and 200 mg twice daily were similar in effectiveness and both were comparable to naproxen 500 mg twice daily.</p>
<p>Although celecoxib 100 mg twice daily and 200 mg twice daily provided similar overall effectiveness, some patients derived additional benefit from the 200 mg twice daily dose. Doses of 400 mg twice daily provided no additional benefit above that seen with 100 to 200 mg twice daily.</p>
<h3>14.3 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis<a id="La504e68b-2f07-40ad-80de-1a0b4ead746a"></a><a id="section-14.3"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, noninferiority study, patients from 2 years to 17 years of age with pauciarticular, polyarticular course JRA or systemic onset JRA (with currently inactive systemic features), received one of the following treatments: celecoxib 3 mg/kg (to a maximum of 150 mg) twice daily; celecoxib 6 mg/kg (to a maximum of 300 mg) twice daily; or naproxen 7.5 mg/kg (to a maximum of 500 mg) twice daily. The response rates were based upon the JRA Definition of Improvement greater than or equal to 30% (JRA DOI 30) criterion, which is a composite of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures of JRA. The JRA DOI 30 response rates at week 12 were 69%, 80% and 67% in the celecoxib 3 mg/kg BID, celecoxib 6 mg/kg BID, and naproxen 7.5 mg/kg BID treatment groups, respectively.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of celecoxib for JRA have not been studied beyond six months. The long-term cardiovascular toxicity in children exposed to celecoxib has not been evaluated and it is unknown if the long-term risk may be similar to that seen in adults exposed to celecoxib or other COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs [(see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].</p>

<p>Celecoxib at doses of 100 mg twice daily, 200 mg once daily and 400 mg once daily was shown to be statistically superior to placebo in these studies for all three co-primary efficacy measures assessing global pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), global disease activity (Visual Analogue Scale) and functional impairment (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index). In the 12-week study, there was no difference in the extent of improvement between the 200 mg and 400 mg celecoxib doses in a comparison of mean change from baseline, but there was a greater percentage of patients who responded to celecoxib 400 mg, 53%, than to celecoxib 200 mg, 44%, using the Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis response criteria (ASAS 20). The ASAS 20 defines a responder as improvement from baseline of at least 20% and an absolute improvement of at least 10 mm, on a 0 to 100 mm scale, in at least three of the four following domains: patient global pain, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, and inflammation. The responder analysis also demonstrated no change in the responder rates beyond 6 weeks.</p>

</h3> <p class="First "> <span class="Italics "> <strong>Adenomatous Polyp Prevention Studies: </strong> </span> </p>
<p>Cardiovascular safety was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three year studies involving patients with Sporadic Adenomatous Polyps treated with celecoxib: the APC trial (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) and the PreSAP trial (Prevention of Spontaneous Adenomatous Polyps). In the APC trial, there was a dose-related increase in the composite endpoint (adjudicated) of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke with celecoxib compared to placebo over 3 years of treatment. The PreSAP trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant increased risk for the same composite endpoint (adjudicated):</p>
<p>• In the APC trial, the hazard ratios compared to placebo for a composite endpoint (adjudicated) of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or     stroke were 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 to 8.5) with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 to 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily. Cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3% (20/671 subjects) and 2.5% (17/685 subjects), respectively, compared to 0.9% (6/679 subjects) with placebo treatment. The increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo-treated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction.</p>
<p> • In the PreSAP trial, the hazard ratio for this same composite endpoint (adjudicated) was 1.2 (95% CI 0.6 to 2.4) with celecoxib 400 mg once daily compared to placebo. Cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 2.3% (21/933 subjects) and 1.9% (12/628 subjects), respectively.</p>
<p>Clinical trials of other COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs of up to three-years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. As a result, all NSAIDs are considered potentially associated with this risk.</p>
<p> <span class="Italics "> <strong>Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS):</strong> </span> </p>
<p>This was a prospective, long-term, safety outcome study conducted post-marketing in approximately 5,800 OA patients and 2,200 RA patients. Patients received celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (common therapeutic doses). Median exposures for celecoxib (n = 3,987) and diclofenac (n = 1,996) were 9 months while ibuprofen (n = 1,985) was 6 months. The primary endpoint of this outcome study was the incidence of complicated ulcers (gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or obstruction). Patients were allowed to take concomitant low-dose (&lt;325 mg/day) aspirin (ASA) for cardiovascular prophylaxis (ASA subgroups: celecoxib, n = 882; diclofenac, n = 445; ibuprofen, n = 412). Differences in the incidence of complicated ulcers between celecoxib and the combined group of ibuprofen and diclofenac were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Patients on celecoxib and concomitant low-dose ASA (N=882) experienced 4-fold higher rates of complicated ulcers compared to those not on ASA (N=3105). The Kaplan-Meier rate for complicated ulcers at 9 months was 1.12% versus 0.32% for those on low-dose ASA and those not on ASA, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</p>
<p>The estimated cumulative rates at 9 months of complicated and symptomatic ulcers for patients treated with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily are described in Table 4. Table 4 also displays results for patients less than or greater than 65 years of age. The difference in rates between celecoxib alone and celecoxib with ASA groups may be due to the higher risk for GI events in ASA users.</p>

<p>In a small number of patients with a history of ulcer disease, the complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates in patients taking celecoxib alone or celecoxib with ASA were, respectively, 2.56% (n=243) and 6.85% (n=91) at 48 weeks. These results are to be expected in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease <em>[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</em> </p>
<p>Cardiovascular safety outcomes were also evaluated in the CLASS trial. Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates for investigator-reported serious cardiovascular thromboembolic adverse events (including MI, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, unstable angina, transient ischemic attacks, and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents) demonstrated no differences between the celecoxib, diclofenac, or ibuprofen treatment groups. The cumulative rates in all patients at nine months for celecoxib, diclofenac, and ibuprofen were 1.2%, 1.4%, and 1.1%, respectively. The cumulative rates in non-ASA users at nine months in each of the three treatment groups were less than 1%. The cumulative rates for myocardial infarction in non-ASA users at nine months in each of the three treatment groups were less than 0.2%. There was no placebo group in the CLASS trial, which limits the ability to determine whether the three drugs tested had no increased risk of CV events or if they all increased the risk to a similar degree.</p>
<p><span class="Italics "><strong>Endoscopic Studies:</strong> </span> The correlation between findings of short-term endoscopic studies with celecoxib and the relative incidence of clinically significant serious upper GI events with longterm use has not been established. Serious clinically significant upper GI bleeding has been observed in patients receiving celecoxib in controlled and open-labeled trials <em>[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)]</em> </p>
<p>A randomized, double-blind study in 430 RA patients was conducted in which an endoscopic examination was performed at 6 months. The incidence of endoscopic ulcers in patients taking celecoxib 200 mg twice daily was 4% vs. 15% for patients taking diclofenac SR 75 mg twice daily. However, celecoxib was not statistically different than diclofenac for clinically relevant GI outcomes in the CLASS trial <em>[see Clinical Studies (14.6)].</em> </p>
<p>The incidence of endoscopic ulcers was studied in two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies in 2157 OA and RA patients in whom baseline endoscopies revealed no ulcers. There was no dose relationship for the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers and the dose of celecoxib (50 mg to 400 mg twice daily). The incidence for naproxen 500 mg twice daily was 16.2 and 17.6% in the two studies, for placebo was 2 and 2.3%, and for all doses of celecoxib the incidence ranged between 2.7% to 5.9%. There have been no large, clinical outcome studies to compare clinically relevant GI outcomes with celecoxib and naproxen.</p>
<p>In the endoscopic studies, approximately 11% of patients were taking aspirin (&lt;325 mg/day). In the celecoxib groups, the endoscopic ulcer rate appeared to be higher in aspirin users than in non-users. However, the increased rate of ulcers in these aspirin users was less than the endoscopic ulcer rates observed in the active comparator groups, with or without aspirin.</p>

</h3> <p class="First ">Patients should be informed that celecoxib is a sulfonamide and can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and seek immediate medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to stop celecoxib immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physician as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Patients with prior history of sulfa allergy should not take celecoxib <em>[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</em> </p>
<h3>17.6 Weight Gain and Edema<a id="Lfa7c6861-a219-4329-82cf-e2b98d6ce332"></a><a id="section-17.6"></a>
</h3> <p class="First ">Long-term administration of NSAIDs including celecoxib has resulted in renal injury. Patients at greatest risk are those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, or with renal or liver dysfunction, heart failure, and the elderly <em>[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8)].</em> </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to promptly report to their physicians signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema following treatment with celecoxib [<em>see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</em> </p>
